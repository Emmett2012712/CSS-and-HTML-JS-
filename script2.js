// in this one we're learning about Functions. //
function myFunction() {
console.log('Code a function and you are cool.')
}
// if you are putting variables inside of your code put it in the parentheses. Nothing will rn when you pt that console.log. You have to put myFunction(); For it to work.//
myFunction();
// You can learn what a document.getElementById is in the next one! //
